# Inventory-System
Introduction
Our project Inventory System is mainly designed for a businessman to manage his/her online store. The project mainly addresses the problem that
the physical stores usually face like they have restrictions on the number of products one can buy at most during sale time. The owner hires users based on his requirements and the user get the product for the lowest price and gets a profit. For e.g. in Christmas, the sales rate is huge. There may be scarce in products. So the clients need to cope up with the competition in order to deliver products to customers in time by 
Businessman. So in these cases, our project is used.

Our project is designed based on the assumptions that the products are assumed to be available by the client and the Shipping receipt provided
by the client is assumed.
